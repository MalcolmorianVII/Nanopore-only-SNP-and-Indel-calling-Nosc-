# NOSC(Nanopore Only SNP and Indel Calling)

# Description
The aim of the project is to investigate the potential use of only sequencing data from nanopore technology i.e. Minion for variant calling process.

# Rationale
Nanopore technology has high error rate compare to illumina generated sequencing data. This presents issues of false positive SNPs and indels.Subsequently this limits the use of nanopore technology  as the sole data required to do genomic investigation e.g. epidemiology.
